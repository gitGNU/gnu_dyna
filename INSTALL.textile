To install, simply copy @include/dynarray.h@ somewhere where your compiler can
find it. On GNU/Linux, it is recommended that you install it into
@/usr/local/include@. If you are developing software with DynArray, then it is
recommended you keep a copy of this distribution without _compiled_
documentation (@doc/dox@) with your package.

h2. Documentation

Documentation is written in a format to be compiled with Doxygen. To build the
documentation, simply start up a terminal and run:

bq. @$ cd doc@
    @$ doxygen@

A prebuilt version of the documentation is distributed in the release Tarballs.

Download Doxygen from @http://www.doxygen.org/index.html@.
